The purpose of this project is to convert the simple Tutorial 4 code from
Screeps to work in VS Code with TypeScript.

Goals:
* have a build command that bakes everything down to 1 JS file
* have a build command that copies that JS to your screeps folder
* provide syntax-correctness for Screeps globals and types
